# Flappy Granny: a game modelled after flappy birds
This game is not a indicator that I can code a game.
I merely followed along a youtube tutorial that was creating flappy bird and changed some pictures and things around. That being said, this is purely for fun.

How to play:
1) Click on link above
2) Wait for a minimum of 5 seconds for the game to load
3) Use your mouse only

Differences from flappy bird:
1) Zombies (obstacles) will appear at random places
2) You are not a bird, you are a grandma shopping in a supermarket

Have Fun!
